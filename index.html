An Education Ministry data, 65.2% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).[70] These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the center government. Example of large center government run school systems are Kendriya Vidyalaya in urban areas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, for the gifted students, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya for girls belonging to vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, Indian Army Public Schools run by the Indian Army for the children of soldiers.</p>

                Most middle-class families send their children to private schools,[71] which might be in their own city or at distant boarding schools. Private schools have been established since the British Rule in India and St George's School, Chennai is the oldest private school in India.[72] At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but Hindi and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject.[73] Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains.</p>
